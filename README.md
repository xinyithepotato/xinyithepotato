## Hi, I'm Xin Yi

# ðŸ’« About Me:
I'm a Final year Computer Science student at Sunway University with a foundation in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and machine learning. Recently, I've been building hands-on experience in cybersecurity risk management, compliance using security frameworks, SOC operations, and cloud-based security. I'm also familiar with web development using modern frameworks and AI engineering on cloud platforms.<br><br>

# ðŸ§  Current Focus:
* Machine Learning for Cybersecurity â€“ applying NLP and ML models for phishing detection and network intrusion analysis.
* Cloud Security Engineering â€“ deploying and securing systems on AWS and GCP, using Terraform and best practices like least-privilege IAM.
* Threat Detection & Monitoring â€“ building SIEM and IDS/IPS solutions with tools like Wazuh and Suricata for real-time analysis.
* Explainable AI (XAI) â€“ integrating SHAP for transparent and interpretable ML model predictions in SOC contexts.
* Automation & Containerization â€“ streamlining deployment using Docker and Bash scripting for scalable, lightweight setups.
* Full-Stack Security Application Development â€“ combining Python, Flask, React, and Tailwind to build security-focused web interfaces and dashboards.
* Infrastructure Hardening & Compliance â€“ enforcing secure configurations and continuous compliance through AWS Security Hub and Config.
