## Hi, I'm Xin Yi

# ðŸ’« About Me:
I'm a Final year Computer Science student at Sunway University with a foundation in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and machine learning. Recently, I've been building hands-on experience in cybersecurity risk management, compliance using security frameworks, SOC operations, and cloud-based security. I'm also familiar with web development using modern frameworks and AI engineering on cloud platforms.<br><br>

# ðŸ§  Current Focus:
* __Machine Learning for Cybersecurity__ â€“ applying NLP and ML models for phishing detection and network intrusion analysis.
* __Cloud Security Engineering__ â€“ deploying and securing systems on AWS and GCP, using Terraform and best practices like least-privilege IAM.
* __Threat Detection & Monitoring__ â€“ building SIEM and IDS/IPS solutions with tools like Wazuh and Suricata for real-time analysis.
* __Explainable AI (XAI)__ â€“ integrating SHAP for transparent and interpretable ML model predictions in SOC contexts.
* __Automation & Containerization__ â€“ streamlining deployment using Docker and Bash scripting for scalable, lightweight setups.
* __Full-Stack Security Application Development__ â€“ combining Python, Flask, React, and Tailwind to build security-focused web interfaces and dashboards.
* __Infrastructure Hardening & Compliance__ â€“ enforcing secure configurations and continuous compliance through AWS Security Hub and Config.
